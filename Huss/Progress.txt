No need for external tool, modify the attackFromKali.py.
Modification complete.
Still need to modify the ServerTest python script to display the messages it received: done
Need to create counter for the 2 proposed defenses :
  - Defense : 
    1.Running the attack on the loop-back IP: Bypassed the strategy of maximum allowed messages per source through randomizing source IPs.
    2.Running the attack on machines on the same network: Bypassed using the same strategy, however I should raise an excpetion so that the source ip doesn't coincide with the destination ip;
    in case of target ip and source ip coinciding: the defense is successful, and no more than maximum allowed messages per source.
